# Summary: Run an executable with the right Ruby version
#
# Usage: rbenv exec COMMAND [arg1 arg2...]
#
# Runs an executable by first preparing PATH so that the selected Ruby
# version is prepended to it.
#
# For example, doing:
#   RBENV_VERSION=1.9.3-p327 rbenv exec bundle install
#
# has an effect is if this was done:
#   PATH=~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p327:"$PATH" bundle install

set -e
[ -n "$RBENV_DEBUG" ] && set -x

# Provide rbenv completions
if [ "$1" = "--complete" ]; then
  exec rbenv shims --short
